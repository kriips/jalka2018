# Pok√©dex üìï ‚Äî DIY [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) + [GraphQL](http://graphql.org) + [React](https://reactjs.org) + [Relay](http://facebook.github.io/relay/en/) workshop

## What is it?

This repository is a **Do It Yourself** workshop teaching you step-by-step the basics of implementing a GraphQL endpoint for your [Phoenix](http://phoenixframework.org) application with huge help of the [Absinthe](http://absinthe-graphql.org) Elixir library. Apart from that, part of the workshop covers the frontend work ‚Äî you'll learn how to add Relay framework to your existing React application and use it to create highly interactive User Interfaces.

## How does it work?

The repository has 6 main branches:

* [firstQuery](https://github.com/sjchmiela/pokedex/tree/firstQuery) ‚Äî given a simple Phoenix application, how to add GraphQL endpoint to it that will fetch some data from the database with Ecto and return as GraphQL response + how to render a list of Pok√©mons fetched from a GraphQL endpoint in React?
* [connections](https://github.com/sjchmiela/pokedex/tree/connections) ‚Äî we already have a simple GraphQL endpoint, how to implement pagination with Absinthe and Relay?
* [authMutations](https://github.com/sjchmiela/pokedex/tree/authMutations) ‚Äî ok, we know how to fetch data in several ways, let's execute some mutations (and obviously authorize the requests)
* [polymorphism](https://github.com/sjchmiela/pokedex/tree/polymorphism) ‚Äî I've heard GraphQL supports interfaces and polymorphism of objects, how to implement this in Absinthe?
* [subscriptions](https://github.com/sjchmiela/pokedex/tree/subscriptions) ‚Äî I'd like to make my UI react to real-time data sent by the backend. Here you'll learn how to push GraphQL-compatible updates to your clients with WebSockets magic
* [batching](https://github.com/sjchmiela/pokedex/tree/batching) ‚Äî your application has so many users that you have to optimize requests sent to the database, the most obvious way will be to get rid of the N+1 issue and batch the requests

Each branch contains the Pok√©dex application in a working state and the codebase is sprinkled with comments `STEP <number>`. Just "search in all" for `STEP 1` on branch `firstQuery` to start the workshop, then for `STEP 2`, when you're finished with `firstQuery` checkout to `connections` search for `STEP 1` and so on.

**Before starting** you'll have to setup the development environment. You can either use the dockerized way, so:

```sh
docker-compose run phoenix mix deps.get
docker-compose run phoenix mix ecto.setup
docker-compose run phoenix yarn
docker-compose up
# Open localhost:4000 to see the application
```

or run the same commands on your `localhost` (but then remember you'll have to check whether DB config in `config/dev.exs` will work on your computer):

```sh
mix deps.get
mix ecto.setup
yarn
mix phx.server
# Open localhost:4000 to see the application
```

## Who did it?

This workshop has been created by two friends for a workshop session during ElixirConf EU 2018 (which BTW was a blast!)
